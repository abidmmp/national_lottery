    <p>Edition 25 effective 17th August 2022</p>
<p><strong>Our Account Terms have changed.</strong></p>

<p>We have changed some of the terms and conditions in these Account Terms. <strong>Please read about the key changes and note that you are bound by the revised Account Terms.</p>

<p>Summary of Changes</strong></p>

<p>The majority of changes clarify the rules that already exist, and make them more reader-friendly. Details of the other main changes are outlined below:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; We have changed the order of precedence of the Game Rules and Game Procedures. Before this update, the Game Procedures would take precedence over the Game Rules in the event of any conflict between the various terms. We have now changed this so that the Game Rules take precedence over the Game Procedures. This is because the Game Rules contain important terms relating to the validity and eligibility of Plays, and Camelot’s liability. </li>

<li> &ndash; We have formalised our policy that business cards should not be registered to a National Lottery Account.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Important Information</strong></p>

<p>These Account Terms contain contractual terms and conditions which are binding on You. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p>Your attention is particularly drawn to the following terms: </p>

<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; You can only register for an Account if You satisfy the conditions set out in <a href="#int_account_registration_1">Section 1.2</a>. If You do not satisfy those conditions, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You (see <a href="#int_account_registration_1">Section 1.7</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; You can only use Your Account when You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man. If You use Your Account to play Games when You are not physically located in the UK or Isle of Man, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of those Games (see <a href="#int_using_your_account_1">Section 2.6</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; These Account Terms contain terms which limit or exclude Camelot’s liability to You, including its liability to pay a Prize to You, in specified circumstances (see <a href="#int_limitation_of_liability_1">Sections 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; In certain situations, Camelot may be required to make decisions which affect You, including whether or not to pay a Prize to You. Provided these decisions are made reasonably by Camelot, they will be final and binding on You (see <a href="#int_camelots_discretion_is_binding_1">Section 13</a>).</li></ul>

<p><strong>The application of the Account Terms</strong></p>

<p>These Account Terms (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) set out the various rules and procedures that apply when You open an Account and use it to play National Lottery games online (including on mobile devices, the App and by direct debit) or for any other reason.</p>

<p>By accepting these Terms, You agree to be bound by the relevant documents below:</p>

<ul class="list" role="presentation">
            <li>(a) When playing Draw-Based Games online through Your Account: these Terms; the <a href="#onlinerules-content">Rules for Draw-Based Games Played Online</a>, the Game Procedures for each individual Draw-Based Game and the Game Specific Rules (if any) for a particular Draw-Based Game;</li>
            <li>(b) When playing Instant Win Games through Your Account: these Terms; the <a href="#instantrules-content">Rules for Interactive Instant Win Games</a>; the Game Procedures for each individual Instant Win Game and the Game Specific Rules (if any) for a particular Instant Win Game.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get copies of the documents by calling the Customer Care Team on 0333&nbsp;234&nbsp;44&nbsp;33<sup>&infin;</sup> (see the Telephone Enquiries section for call charges) or by writing to The National Lottery, PO Box 251, Watford WD18 9BR.</p>

<p>All words and phrases in these Terms that begin with a capital letter and have a specific meaning are explained below or in <a href="#int_definitions_1">Section 16</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="header_small" id="int_account_registration_1">1. Account Registration</h2>
<ul class="list">
                <li>1.1 You are only allowed to have one Account.</li>
                <li>1.2 You can only register for an Account if, at the time of registration: 
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) You are 18 or over;</li>
                    <li>(b) You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man;</li>
                    <li>(c) You are recognised by checks carried out by Camelot as being a resident of the UK or Isle of Man; </li>
                    <li>(d) where debit card details have been supplied, the debit card details supplied are those of a UK or Isle of Man debit card linked to a UK or Isle of Man bank or building society account that You are an authorised user of  and that is not a business account. You agree that any Prize won may be paid back to the debit card.  If You register a debit card for a joint account, You will be authorising Camelot to pay any Prize won to that debit card and this may amount to disclosure of the Prize to other holders of that joint account; </li>
                    <li>(e) the card referred to in Section 1.2(d) has not been reported as lost or stolen or has not been supplied in relation to another Account; and</li>
                    <li>(f) where required, You are able to verify, in whatever way Camelot decides, that any information supplied to Camelot is genuine.</li>
                  </ul>
                 
                
                <li>1.3 You will need to provide certain information when applying to open an Account to help Camelot establish whether or not You and/or Your debit card (where debit card details are supplied) meet the criteria set out in Section 1.2 and whether You are eligible to play the Games. This information may include, for example, Your name, address, date of birth, gender, email address, debit card details and Your own security questions. Camelot reserves the right to carry out checks to establish the above and to verify (or ask an authentication agency to carry out checks to verify) Your age and identity and any other details provided (for example Your bank account details), and to ask You for further documentation to verify the same.</li>
                <li>1.4 Camelot may also request information from You or carry out checks after You have opened an Account, to ensure that You and/or Your debit card (where debit card details are supplied) still meet the criteria set out in Section 1.2.</li>
                <li>1.5 Camelot reserves the right to refuse an application to open an Account for any reason.</li>
                <li>1.6 If Camelot subsequently discovers that You were not or are no longer eligible to open, hold or use an Account, Camelot reserves the right to take all appropriate steps in relation to You and Your Account (including, without limitation, suspending or terminating Your Account, and investigating any security issues). </li>
                <li>1.7 Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to anyone that does not meet the criteria set out in Section 1.2 and may (at its discretion) refuse to pay a Prize to anyone that has more than one Account (including any Account that You have been permanently excluded from and cannot access). If a Prize is paid to anyone who does not meet those criteria, that person will be required to repay the Prize immediately if Camelot requests it. </li>
<li>1.8 Only the Account holder who registered for the Account can use that Account. Camelot will not be liable to pay any Prize to You if You play via another Player’s Account, or if another person plays via Your Account (with or without Your permission).</li>

              <ul class="list">
                <li>2.1 You must only access Your Account when You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man.</li>
                <li>2.2 If You successfully open an Account but didn&rsquo;t provide debit card details during the application process, You will only be able to play Try Games (and certain Draw-Based Games by Direct Debit).</li>
                <li>2.3 You will only be able to buy Plays with Your Account once You have registered a debit card (which must satisfy the criteria set out in Sections 1.2(d) and (e)) to it or You have set up a Direct Debit. You must be physically located in the UK or Isle of Man when providing these details. Camelot may, from time to time, impose limits and conditions on when and how often You can change the debit card details registered to Your Account.</li>
                <li>2.4 You are responsible for making sure all of Your Account information is accurate and up to date. You can only update or change certain Games-Related Information. Any updates and changes (including to Your Direct Debit details) must be made whilst You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man. The updates can only be done through Your Account, unless Camelot (acting reasonably) decides otherwise in its discretion (and in exceptional circumstances). </li>
                <li>2.5 You are responsible for the security of Your Account  and for keeping Your login details secure and secret at all times, and Your password unique. You must take steps to prevent Your Account and password being used without Your permission.</li>                               
                <li>2.6 Using Your Account (including playing the Games) whilst located in any place other than the UK or the Isle of Man is strictly prohibited. Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of any Games played whilst You were located in any place other than the UK or Isle of Man. Camelot has the right to terminate Your Account and any associated active Direct Debit, and refuse any and all current or future Plays by You or access to the Site and/or App by You if it suspects or knows that You have played or are intending to play the Games whilst located in any place other than the UK or Isle of Man.  </li>

              <ul class="list">
                <li>3.1	Once You have provided debit card details for Your Account, You can add funds to Your Account from that debit card. Camelot will determine whether the funds You have requested to add to Your Account are available. Once this has been confirmed and the transaction is authorised by your bank, the funds will be added to Your Account. </li>
                <li>3.2 There will be a minimum and maximum amount that can be added to Your Account at any one time and/or during any period of time and/or in any one transaction. The minimum and maximum amounts will be set by Camelot and specified on the "Add funds" section of Your Account. Subject to any limit imposed by Camelot under this Section, You will also be able to set Your own “add funds” limit through Your Account. Details of the limits You can set will be set out in the <a href="service-guide" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Service Guide</a> and in the “Spend and Play Settings” area of Your Account. More information about the impact of setting limits on your Account is set out in the <a href="service-guide" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Service Guide</a>. </li>
                <li>3.3 Camelot may also, at any time, impose a maximum Account balance that You will only be able to exceed if You choose to download Prizes into Your Account. Any maximum Account balance will be communicated to You in any way Camelot decides from time to time, including in the <a href="service-guide" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Service Guide</a> available on the Site and App. </li>
<li>3.4 You can withdraw funds from Your Account, unless the debit card registered to Your Account has expired or Your Account has been suspended. On withdrawal of funds, provided that the debit card registered to Your Account is valid, Camelot will return the relevant funds to that debit card. If Camelot is unable to return the funds to that debit card, the funds will remain in Your Account and will be subject to the Dormant Account process (see Section 8).</li>
<li>3.5 You won’t receive or be entitled to interest on funds in Your Account or on any Prizes.</li></ul>

                <li>4.1 Camelot may, at its discretion, impose limits on the number of times You can play a Try Game, and/or the number of Plays You can buy, during a defined time period. Any limits imposed under this Section 4.1 will be notified to You in an appropriate manner by Camelot, including, for example, by including the limits in the <a href="service-guide" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Service Guide</a>. There will also be a maximum amount that You can spend on Plays using funds in Your Account during a period of time. The maximum amount will be set by Camelot and specified in the “Spend and Play Settings” section of Your Account. </li>
                <li>4.2 Subject to any limits imposed by Camelot under Section 4.1, You will be able to set Your own limits and exclusions on Your Plays, and Your own spend limit through Your Account. You are also able to permanently exclude Yourself, or temporarily exclude Yourself for a fixed period of at least one day, from Your Account (and, therefore, from playing all Games). You can do this through Your Account or by contacting the Customer Care Team. You can also exclude Yourself from playing all Instant Win Games by registering with GAMSTOP. Details of the limits You can set and the effect of exclusion (including via GAMSTOP) are set out in the <a href="service-guide" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Service Guide</a>.</li>

                <li>6.3 Camelot may terminate, vary or suspend the provision of the Games, access to Your Account and/or to the Site and/or the App, and refuse any and all current or future playing of the Games by You, immediately and without giving You prior notice:

                    <li>(b) If Camelot isn&rsquo;t able to return those funds to You, it will keep those funds for six years from the date the Account was closed or terminated (or You permanently excluded Yourself) or the Direct Debit was closed. After this time, the funds will be allocated to the National Lottery Distribution Fund. The former Player can contact Camelot at any time during that 6 year period to claim the funds and, as long as they are able to provide any information Camelot reasonably requires, Camelot will then refund the funds. No interest will be payable in respect of monies refunded.</li>
                    <li>(c) If You have an active Direct Debit and You have requested to close Your Account, have temporarily excluded Yourself from Your Account, have permanently excluded Yourself from Your Account, or if Your Account has been terminated, Camelot will cancel Your Direct Debit. Your Account will only be closed once any Direct Debit payment already collected or in the process of being collected has been used to buy Plays in line with the Direct Debit and any Prizes due in relation to those Plays have been paid. Alternatively Camelot may, in exceptional circumstances and at its discretion, return any funds outstanding in respect of the Direct Debit to the bank or building society account linked to Your Direct Debit, or by any other appropriate method. If You have temporarily excluded Yourself for 6 months or permanently excluded Yourself, Account exclusion will be immediate. Prizes due in relation to Direct Debit Plays must be claimed in the usual way (see Rule 3 of the Rules for <a href="account-terms.html#int_playing_by_direct_debit_2">Draw-Based Games Played Online</a>).</li>

    <p>Edition 21 effective 17th August 2022</p>
<p><strong>Our Rules for Draw-Based Games Played Online have changed.</strong></p>

<p>We have changed some of the terms and conditions in these Rules. <strong>Please read about the key changes and note that you are bound by the revised Rules.</p>

<p>Summary of Changes</strong></p>

<p>The majority of changes clarify the rules that already exist, and make them more reader-friendly. Details of the other main changes are outlined below:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; We have changed the order of precedence of the Game Rules and Game Procedures. Before this update, the Game Procedures would take precedence over the Game Rules in the event of any conflict between the various terms. We have now changed this so that the Game Rules take precedence over the Game Procedures. This is because the Game Rules contain important terms relating to the validity and eligibility of Plays, and Camelot&rsquo;s liability. </li>

<li> &ndash; We have formalised our entitlement to pay all or part of the Prize to the Official Receiver or Your trustee in bankruptcy in the event of Your bankruptcy.</li>

<li> &ndash; We will be entitled to declare an Entry invalid (and a Prize may not be payable) if we are not satisfied that the Entry has been bought in good faith, or that the claim is not made in good faith. We will also be entitled to declare an Entry invalid if it is not recorded on Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System, is not entered into a Draw, or the Draw is conducted without taking the Entry into account. </li></ul>

<p><strong>Important Information</strong></p>

<p>These Rules for Draw-Based Games Played Online (the “Rules”) contain contractual terms and conditions which are binding on You. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p>Your attention is specifically drawn to the following:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; You can only buy an Entry and play Games Played Online when You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man. If You buy an Entry or play Games Played Online when You are not physically located in the UK or Isle of Man, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of those Games (see <a href="#int_buying_entries_2">Rule 1.10</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; Your Entry will only be valid if it is recorded on Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System (see <a href="#int_buying_entries_2">Rule 1.4</a>).  Further, Camelot is entitled to declare an entry invalid (and, if it does so, will not be liable to pay a Prize) if the Entry is not entered into the Draw, or the Draw is conducted without taking the Entry into account (see <a href="#int_validation_requirements_2">Rule 6.3(e))</a>.</li>

<li> &ndash; A Prize will not be paid to You unless and until the relevant Entry has been validated by Camelot in accordance with <a href="#int_validation_requirements_2">Rule 6</a>.</li>

<li> &ndash; These Rules contain terms which limit or exclude Camelot&rsquo;s liability to You, including its liability to pay a Prize to You, in specified circumstances (see <a href="#int_limitation_of_liability_2">Rule 11</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; In certain situations, Camelot may be required to make decisions which affect You, including whether or not to pay a Prize to You. Provided those decisions are made reasonably by Camelot, they will be final and binding on You (see <a href="#int_disputes_and_camelots_decisions_2">Rule 12 .1</a>).</li></ul>

<p><strong>The application of these Rules</strong></p>

<p>Together with the Account Terms, these Rules apply when You play any Draw-Based Game online, including buying Entries by Direct Debit or via the App. Each Draw-Based Game also has its own Game Procedures that apply, and certain Draw-Based Games may also have their own Game Specific Rules that apply from time to time. </p>

<p>You can view all National Lottery Rules and Procedures, the Account Terms and the <a href="privacy-policy" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Privacy Policy</a>, on the <a href="index.html">National Lottery website</a>. You can also get copies of these documents by calling the Customer Care Team on 0333 234 44 33<sup>&infin;</sup> (see the <a href="contact-us.html#get-in-touch" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Telephone Enquiries section</a> for call charges) or by writing to The National Lottery, PO Box 251, Watford WD18 9BR.</p>

<p>If You are playing Draw-Based Games at National Lottery retailers, the <a href="games/in-store/rules" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="ico ico_after ico_window">Rules for Draw-Based Games Played at Retailers</a> apply.</p>
 
 <p>All words and phrases in these Rules that begin with a capital letter and have specific meaning are explained below or in Rule 16.</p>

    <h2 class="header_small" id="int_buying_entries_2">1. Buying Entries</h2>
<ul class="list">
                <li>1.1 Unless You&rsquo;ve set up a Direct Debit in line with Rule 3, You can only buy an Entry if You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man. You must also be logged into, and have a debit card registered to, Your Account.</li>
				
                <li>1.2 Each Entry must be bought for its full price, unless Entries are given away for free by Camelot in a promotion or as prizes for National Lottery games. Entries can only be bought from Camelot.</li>
				
                <li>1.3 A Selection won&rsquo;t be entered into a Draw after the relevant Draw Break (subject to Rule 8.8). This will usually be 30 minutes before the relevant Draw takes place. </li>
				
                <li>1.4 Your Entry will only be valid if it is recorded on Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System. </li>
				
                <li>1.5 You can only buy Entries and receive Prizes in line with these Rules, the Account Terms and the Game Procedures and any Game Specific Rules that apply to a Game.</li>
				
                <li>1.6 There is no general right for a person to buy an Entry. Camelot can refuse to sell Entries to anyone, and/or limit the number of Entries You can buy, without giving a reason. </li>
				
                <li>1.7 Subject to Rule 1.9, the following people cannot buy an Entry (and Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to them):
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) anyone under the age of 18, whether that person is buying it for themselves or anyone else;</li>
<li>(b) directors and employees of Camelot;</li>
                    <li>(c) specified employees of any of Camelot&rsquo;s key contractors or sub-contractors (as specified by the Commission from time to time);</li>
                    <li>(d) personal partners and persons who are, to some extent, maintained by anyone mentioned in Rules 1.7(b) or (c), in either case if living in the same household as that person;</li>
                    <li>(e) any person who has an Account which has a status that prohibits them from buying an Entry or receiving a Prize (including without limitation a person whose Account has been suspended or terminated);</li>
                    <li>(f) any person who is not physically located in the UK or Isle of Man when seeking to buy, or at the time of buying, the relevant Entry;</li>
                    <li>(g) any person who does not meet the criteria set out in Section 1.2 of the Account Terms  (and, for those who play by Direct Debit, Rule 3.2 of these Rules);</li>
                    <li>(h) any person who is prevented from playing under the Commission&rsquo;s Codes of Conduct; and</li>
                    <li>(i) anyone else Camelot and the Commission may decide and specify in any amendment which is made to these Rules or in any other appropriately published communication from time to time.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
				
                <li>1.8 If You receive a Prize for a Game Played Online that You were not entitled to play, You must repay the Prize immediately if Camelot requests it.</li>
							
				
                <li>1.9 With the Commission&rsquo;s written consent, Camelot employees will be able to buy Entries but only for the purpose of testing Accounts and how they operate. The Commission may impose conditions on any consent granted including, for example, that Camelot employees and Camelot will not be entitled to benefit from any Prize won by any such Entries.</li>
				
                <li>1.10 You agree that playing the Games Played Online whilst located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or the Isle of Man is strictly prohibited. You also agree that Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of any Games Played Online that You played or any Entry purchased whilst located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or Isle of Man. Camelot has the right to terminate Your Account and any associated active Direct Debit,  and/or refuse any and all current or future Entries by You or access to the Site and/or App by You if it suspects or knows that You have played or are intending to play the Games Played Online whilst located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or Isle of Man.  </li>

               <li>1.11 Only the Account holder who registered for the Account can use that Account. Camelot will not be liable to pay any Prize to You if You play via another Player&rsquo;s Account, or if another person plays via Your Account (with or without Your permission).</li></ul>

 <ul class="list">
                <li>3.1 Some Games can be played by Direct Debit. You must be 18 or over and physically located in the UK or Isle of Man when submitting Your application to play by Direct Debit (including the payment authority).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Application process and requirements</strong></p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>3.2 You must satisfy the following criteria before a Direct Debit can start and, once it has started, whilst it continues: 
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a)	You must be recognised by checks carried out by Camelot as being a resident of the UK or Isle of Man;</li>
                    <li>(b)	You must have a UK or Isle of Man bank or building society account from which the Direct Debit payment will be taken<sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup>;</li>
                    <li>(c)	where required, You are able to verify, in whatever way Camelot decides, that any information supplied to Camelot is genuine; and</li>
                    <li>(d)	You must not be in any of the categories of people referred to in Rule 1.7.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup>You agree that any Direct Debit Prize won may be paid into the bank or building society account the Direct Debit payments are taken from. If You use a joint account to pay for Your Direct Debit, You will be authorising Camelot to pay any Direct Debit Prize by direct credit into that account and this may amount to disclosure of the Direct Debit Prize to other holders of that account.</p>
                </li>
                <li>3.3 You will need to provide certain information to Camelot during the application process (including payment details) which will help Camelot determine whether or not You meet the criteria set out above and verify Your eligibility to play by Direct Debit. Camelot reserves the right to ask an authentication agency to verify this information.</li>
                <li>3.4 Camelot may have to share any personal information You provide when applying for a Direct Debit (or whilst Your Direct Debit is effective or at any other time) with the Commission. Camelot may also share this information with third parties in order to process an application and to manage Your Account and Direct Debit once the application is processed. Camelot and third parties on its behalf may carry out checks to ensure that You are entitled to authorise the Direct Debit and that You have enough funds to play the Games You have chosen to play.  </li>
                <li>3.5 Payment for Your Direct Debit Entries will be made by Direct Debit to Camelot or any other third party nominated by Camelot, or by any other method Camelot allows from time to time.</li>
                <li>3.6 Camelot can refuse to accept a Direct Debit application for any reason, including if it is not satisfied that the information provided is adequate and/or has been verified by Camelot or any authentication agency.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Your Direct Debit information</strong></p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>3.7 You should check all of the details on Your Interactive Play Slip are correct before confirming You wish to proceed with the Direct Debit. You are solely responsible for checking that Your Direct Debit Play Slip shows the correct Selections, Games and number of Draws a week You wish to enter and that Your Direct Debit Details are accurate. If the details aren&rsquo;t correct, You will need to delete the Direct Debit Play Slip and set up a new one - see Rule 3.11. You are also responsible for noting the start date of Your Direct Debit and checking that the details on Your Ticket are correct. </li>
                <li>3.8 Camelot won&rsquo;t be responsible for any mistakes or omissions in respect of data recorded on any Direct Debit Play Slip, Direct Debit Details or Tickets. Camelot will also not be liable for any loss of whatever nature suffered or incurred by any person as a result of any such mistakes or omissions affecting a Direct Debit Play Slip, Direct Debit Details or Tickets.</li>
                <li>3.9 If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the information (including the Selections) contained in the Direct Debit Play Slip, the Direct Debit Details and/or the Tickets and the information contained in Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System, the information registered in Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System will take priority. </li>
                <li>3.10 Camelot&rsquo;s liability for any loss of whatever nature suffered or incurred by You as a result of any conflict or inconsistency (whether it was caused by an act or omission of Camelot, its employees, retailers, co-promoters or other third parties and, whether in negligence or otherwise) is limited to the amount You paid for the Direct Debit Entry for which You suffered loss.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Making changes</strong></p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>3.11 You cannot edit Your Direct Debit Play Slip. This means that if You want to make any changes (for example change Your Selection, add or remove lines, or add or remove Draw days) You will need to delete the relevant Direct Debit Play Slip and set up a new one with the required changes. If the bank or building society details for Your Direct Debit are wrong, You should contact Your bank or building society or Camelot as soon as possible to update the details. Deletion of a Direct Debit Play Slip or any changes to the associated bank or building society account details may not be effective immediately - see Rule 3.22 for more information. </li>
                <li>3.12 You can make changes to Your name and address through Your Account. You can also notify Camelot in writing of any changes (or in any other way Camelot allows from time to time). The notification must be sent to The National Lottery PO Box 251 Watford WD18 9BR or any other address advised by Camelot and must be signed by You. Proof of identity may need to be provided before any changes to Your name and address can be made.</li>
                <li>3.13 You must be physically located in the UK or Isle of Man when making any changes to Your Direct Debit (including deleting and adding Direct Debit Play Slips).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Entry into a Draw</strong></p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>3.14 Only the numbers registered in Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System will be entered into the Draws on the Draw dates registered in Camelot&rsquo;s Computer System.</li>
                <li>3.15 If Camelot hasn&rsquo;t received Your payment at least 48 hours before the relevant Draw (or any other period of time advised by Camelot), it is highly unlikely that Your Selection will be entered into that Draw, in which case You won&rsquo;t be entitled to any Direct Debit Prize for that Draw with that Selection. Before the Draw, You should check Your Account to see if Your Selection has been entered. </li>
                <li>3.16 Camelot reserves the right to cancel Your Direct Debit Play Slip if Your Direct Debit payment fails or if it doesn&rsquo;t receive the relevant payment within the period referred to in Rule 3.15 or if it receives payment but the payment fails after the relevant Draw for whatever reason.</li>
                <li>3.17 A Direct Debit Entry will be void and You won&rsquo;t be entitled to any Direct Debit Prize for that Direct Debit Entry if:
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) Camelot hasn&rsquo;t received the payment for that Direct Debit Entry;</li>

                <li>3.20 Without limiting the effect of Rules 3.9, 3.14 and 3.17, Your Direct Debit will start on the date of the first Draw recorded on Your Direct Debit Details. Your Direct Debit must be for a rolling term.</li>

If You cancel the entire Direct Debit instruction, all of Your Direct Debit Play Slips will be deleted automatically.

Cancellation of a Direct Debit or deletion of a Direct Debit Play Slip will only be effective once the Direct Debit payment already in the process of being collected by Camelot from Your bank or building society account has been used to buy Direct Debit Entries. This Rule applies unless Camelot decides there are reasonable grounds for a refund to be provided. If You exclude Yourself from Your Account as stated above, exclusion will be immediate (and You won&rsquo;t be able to access Your Account) but You will still be entered into the Draws that Camelot has started the process of collecting payment for.</li>

Camelot reserves the right to cancel or change Your Direct Debit Play Slip or Direct Debit Entry (or any condition attaching to a Direct Debit Play Slip or Direct Debit Entry) to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect any such Game cancellation or change.

No interest will be payable in respect of any refund made.</li>

In this case, cancellation will be effective after the last Draw(s) Your payment has already been collected for; or</li>
                    <li>(b)	refund any money You have already paid for those Draws of the relevant Game(s) taking place after the cancellation to the bank or building society account registered to Your Direct Debit, or by any other appropriate method, and pay any unpaid Direct Debit Prizes due to You for any Draws that took place before the cancellation. In this case, cancellation will be effective from the next Draw(s) of the Game(s) Your Direct Debit Play Slip relates to. No interest will be payable in respect of any refund made.</li>

                </li>
                <li>3.29 You will not be entitled to any Direct Debit Prizes for Direct Debit Entries bought under Rule 3.26 or Rule 3.28(a) if You have recovered the Direct Debit payment used to buy those Direct Debit Entries.</li>
                <li>3.30 If Camelot is not able to return any money owed to You in relation to Your Direct Debit, it will be held for 6 years from the date Your Direct Debit was cancelled or terminated, after which it will be allocated to the National Lottery Distribution Fund. You can contact Camelot at any time during the 6 years to claim the money and, providing You are able to provide the information Camelot reasonably requires, the money will be refunded to You. No interest will be payable in respect of monies refunded.</li>

                <li>5.2 In certain circumstances, Camelot may decide (in writing and subject to any terms and conditions imposed by Camelot) that a Prize Claim Form does not need to be submitted.</li>
                <li>5.3 The Prize Claim Form must be completed in the name of, and signed by, the holder of the relevant Account and be submitted with any Identification Information required by Camelot to prove that they are the sole holder of the Account containing the Winning Entry. If the Account holder is unable to complete a Prize Claim Form due to legal, physical or other disability, their authorised representative can complete the Prize Claim Form in the Account holder&rsquo;s name and sign it on their behalf. The Prize Claim Form must state the Account holder&rsquo;s name and the name of their authorised representative, and must describe the authorised representative&rsquo;s status. Camelot is entitled (but is not required) to ask the authorised representative for evidence to prove they are allowed to claim on the Account holder&rsquo;s behalf. </li>
                <li>5.4 A person can claim on behalf of a deceased Player&rsquo;s estate if they can prove, to Camelot&rsquo;s reasonable satisfaction, that they are entitled to make the claim (for example by providing a grant of probate to show their appointment as a personal representative of the deceased Player&rsquo;s estate). The person claiming will need to submit any relevant proof with the Prize Claim Form, or any other form Camelot may require. </li>
                <li>5.5 The person signing the Prize Claim Form (or any other form Camelot requires) will, if they are signing as the holder of the relevant Account, be representing that they are lawfully entitled to the Prize (or, if signing as authorised representative of the holder of the relevant Account, that they are lawfully entitled to claim the Prize on behalf of the holder) and that the information contained in the Prize Claim Form is accurate and complete. That person signing the Prize Claim Form or any other form Camelot requires (and the holder of the relevant Account, if the authorised representative is signing) will indemnify Camelot against any costs, losses, damages and expenses which Camelot may incur in relation to the Entry or the Prize as a result of any misrepresentation on the Prize Claim Form (or such other form Camelot requires).</li>
                <li>5.6 Once payment of the Prize has been made to the person shown on the Prize Claim Form or any other form Camelot requires (or that person&rsquo;s authorised representative), Camelot and its officers, employees, representatives, contractors and any person, firm or company authorised by Camelot to pay Prizes will have no further liability for payment of that Prize.</li>
                <li>5.7 Camelot is entitled to refuse to process any payment if a Prize Claim Form (or any other form required by Camelot) is incomplete.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Camelot will decide which of (a) or (b) above shall apply.</p>

    <p>Edition 16 effective 17th August 2022</p>
<p><strong>Our Rules for Interactive Instant Win Games have changed.</strong></p>

<p>We have changed some of the terms and conditions in these Rules. <strong>Please read about the key changes and note that you are bound by the revised Rules.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary of Changes</strong></p>

<p>The majority of changes clarify the rules that already exist, and make them more reader-friendly. Details of the other main changes are outlined below:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; We have changed the order of precedence of the Game Rules and Game Procedures. Before this update, the Game Procedures would take precedence over the Game Rules in the event of any conflict between the various terms. We have now changed this so that the Game Rules take precedence over the Game Procedures. This is because the Game Rules contain important terms relating to the validity and eligibility of Plays, and Camelot’s liability. </li>

<li> &ndash; We have formalised our entitlement to pay all or part of the Prize to the Official Receiver or Your trustee in bankruptcy in the event of Your bankruptcy.</li>

<li> &ndash; A Play will be declared invalid if for any reason (including an error in the coding) the Game operates differently to its Game Procedures or operates so that Your chances of winning are materially greater than set out in the Game Procedures. </li>

<li> &ndash; We will be entitled to declare a Play invalid (and a Prize may not be payable) if we are not satisfied that the Play has been bought in good faith, or that the claim is not made in good faith. </li></ul>

<p><strong>Important Information</strong></p>

<p>These Rules for Interactive Instant Win Games (the “Rules”) contain contractual terms and conditions which are binding on You. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p>Your attention is specifically drawn to the following:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li> &ndash; You can only buy a Play and play Instant Win Games when You are physically located in the UK or Isle of Man. If You buy a Play or play Instant  Win Games when You are not physically located in the UK or Isle of Man, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of those Games (see <a href="#int_playing_instant_win_games_3">Rule 1.9</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; The outcome of all Instant Win Games is predetermined at the point You buy a Play. The outcome is not affected by You exercising any skill or judgement when playing the Instant Win Game (see <a href="#int_games_of_chance_3">Rule 3</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; You will only be entitled to claim the Prize (if any) that is shown on Camelot’s Computer System as having been won for the relevant Play, irrespective of the outcome of the Play displayed on the Game Play Window (see <a href="#int_claiming_a_prize_3">Rule 4.2</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; A Prize will not be paid to You unless and until the Play in question has been validated by Camelot in accordance with <a href="#int_validation_requirements_3">Rule 6</a>. </li>

<li> &ndash; These Rules contain terms which limit or exclude Camelot’s liability to You, including its liability to pay a Prize to You, in specified circumstances (see <a href="#int_validation_requirements_3">Rule 6</a> and <a href="#int_limitation_of_liability_3">Rule 11</a>).</li>

<li> &ndash; In certain situations, Camelot may be required to make decisions which affect You, including whether or not to pay a Prize to You. Provided those decisions are made reasonably by Camelot, they will be final and binding on You (see <a href="#int_disputes_and_camelots_decisions_3">Rule 12 .1</a>).</li></ul>

<p><strong>The application of these Rules</strong></p>

<p>Together with the Account Terms, these Rules apply when You play any National Lottery Instant Win Game on the Site or on the App. Each Instant Win Game also has its own Game Procedures that apply, and certain Instant Win Games may also have their own Game Specific Rules that apply from time to time. </p>

<p>You can view all National Lottery Rules, the Account Terms and the <a title="Opens in a new window" class="ico ico_after ico_window" target="_blank" href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, on the National Lottery website. The Game Procedures for each Game will be available to view on the device used to buy the Game (i.e. on the National Lottery website if buying the Game on the website, and on the App if buying the Game on the App). </p>

<p>You can also get copies of these documents by calling the Customer Care Team on 0333&nbsp;234&nbsp;44&nbsp;33<sup>&infin;</sup> (see the Telephone Enquiries section for call charges) or by writing to The National Lottery at PO Box 251, Watford WD18 9BR.</p>

<p>All words and phrases in these Rules that begin with a capital letter and have specific meaning are explained below or in Rule 15.</p>

                <li>1.3 You can only buy Plays and receive Prizes in line with these Rules, the Account Terms,  and the Game Procedures and any Game Specific Rules that apply to an Instant Win Game.</li>
                <li>1.4 Camelot may refuse or limit Your access to any Instant Win Games without giving a reason. </li>
                <li>1.5 Subject to any limits imposed by Camelot, You can set limits on the number of Pay to Play Games You can play in a day. You can also exclude Yourself from playing all Instant Win Games, or selected Instant Win Games. You can set these limits and exclusions through Your Account if You have one. You will need to contact the Customer Care Team to reverse any exclusions made.</li>
                <li>1.6 Subject to Rule 1.9, the following people cannot buy a Play (and Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to them):</li>

 <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) anyone under the age of 18, whether that person is buying it for themselves or anyone else; </li>

                    <li>(d) personal partners and persons who are, to some extent, maintained by anyone mentioned in Rules 1.6(b) or (c), in either case if living in the same household as that person; </li>
                    <li>(e) any person who has an Account which has a status that prohibits them from playing Instant Win Games or receiving a Prize (including, without limitation, a person whose Account has been suspended or terminated); </li>
                    <li>(f) any person who is not located in the UK or the Isle of Man when seeking to buy, or at the time of buying, the relevant Play;</li>
                    <li>(g) any person who doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria set out in <a href="account-terms.html#int_account_registration_1">Section 1.2 of the Account Terms;</a>  </li>
                    <li>(h) any person who is prevented from playing under the Commission&rsquo;s Codes of Conduct; and</li>
                    <li>(i) anyone else Camelot and the Commission may decide and specify in any amendment which is made to these Rules or in any other appropriately published communication from time to time.</li></ul>

                <li>1.7 If You receive a Prize for an Instant Win Game that You were not entitled to play, You must repay the Prize immediately if Camelot requests it. </li>
                <li>1.8 With the Commission’s consent, Camelot employees will be able to buy Plays but only for the purpose of testing Accounts and how they operate. The Commission may impose conditions on any consent granted including, for example, that Camelot employees and Camelot will not be entitled to benefit from any Prize won by any such Plays.  </li>
                <li>1.9 You agree that playing the Instant Win Games whilst located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or the Isle of Man is strictly prohibited. You also agree that Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You in respect of any Instant Win Games played or any Play purchased whilst You were located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or Isle of Man. Camelot has the right to terminate Your Account and/or refuse any and all current or future Plays by You or access to the Site and/or App if it suspects or knows that You have played or are intending to play the Instant Win Games whilst located in any jurisdiction other than the UK or Isle of Man.  </li>
		<li>1.10 Only the Account holder who registered for the Account can use that Account. Camelot will not be liable to pay any Prize to You if You play via another Player’s Account, or if another person plays via Your Account (with or without Your permission).</li></ul>

<p>Instant Win Games are electronic games of pure chance. The outcome is predetermined by a random process when the Play starts and is not influenced by any exercise of skill or judgement by You. Statistics about the chances of winning Prizes and the approximate expected Prize payout percentage for each Instant Win Game are set out in the Game Procedures. However, Camelot makes no warranties or representations in relation to the chances of winning.</p>

<ul class="list">
                <li>4.1 Subject to Rule 5.4, You can only claim a Prize if You are the holder of an Account with the relevant Winning Play. A purchase confirmation made available or sent to You by Camelot cannot be used under any circumstances as evidence that You are entitled to a Prize.</li>
                <li>4.2 You will only be entitled to claim the Prize that is shown on Camelot’s Computer System as having been won for the relevant Play. If no Prize is shown as having been won for the relevant Play on Camelot’s Computer System, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize to You, irrespective of the outcome of the Play displayed on the Game Play Window. Prizes must be claimed before the end of the 180th day after the day on which You bought the relevant Play and within the hours set out in Rule 4.3 (the “Claim Period”). Your entitlement to a Prize will be lost (and the Prize won’t be paid) if a Prize is not claimed within the Claim Period. See Rule 7.1 for how to claim Your Prize.</li>
                <li>4.3 If You are claiming a Prize:
                  <ul class="list">
                <li>(a) through Your Account by confirming payment should be made to You, You must do this before 11.00pm on the last day of the Claim Period;</li>
                <li>(b) by phoning the Customer Care Team, You must phone during the Customer Care Team’s normal opening hours which, at the time of writing these Rules, are 8.00am to 8.00pm Monday to Saturday and 9am to 5pm Sundays - reduced opening hours may apply over the Christmas and New Year period. See the Site for <a href="contact-us.html#get-in-touch">current opening hours;</a> </li>
                <li>(c) in person from Camelot, Camelot must receive sufficient information to prove You are the holder of the Account that has the Winning Play, together with a completed Prize Claim Form or any other form Camelot requires You to complete (where required), at any Regional Centre during Camelot’s normal business hours* within the Claim Period; or, in the case of a claim for a Prize over &pound;50,000, at Your home or other agreed location at the time agreed by Camelot, within the Claim Period. </li>
                <li> *Camelot’s Watford Regional Centre’s normal business hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday (excluding Bank Holidays). Camelot’s Liverpool Regional Centre’s normal business hours are 8.30am to 4.30pm Monday to Thursday and 8.30am to 4pm Fridays (excluding Bank Holidays). Reduced hours may apply over the Christmas and New Year period. </li>

    <h2 class="header_small" id="int_prize_claim_forms_3">5. Prize Claim Forms</h2>
<ul class="list">
                <li>5.1 You must provide a completed Prize Claim Form when claiming a Prize of, or worth, over &pound;50,000. Camelot can also, at its discretion, require a completed Prize Claim Form (or any other form issued by Camelot) to be provided for any other Prize. Prize Claim Forms will be provided by Camelot.</li>
                <li>5.2 In certain circumstances, Camelot may decide (in writing and subject to any terms and conditions imposed by Camelot) that a Prize Claim Form does not need to be submitted.</li>
                <li>5.3 The Prize Claim Form must be completed in the name of, and signed by, the holder of the relevant Account and be submitted with any Identification Information required by Camelot to prove that they are the sole holder of the Account containing the Winning Play. If the Account holder is unable to complete a Prize Claim Form due to legal, physical or other disability, their authorised representative can complete the Prize Claim Form in the Account holder’s name and sign it on their behalf. The Prize Claim Form must state the Account holder’s name and the name of their authorised representative, and must describe the authorised representative’s status. Camelot is entitled (but is not required) to ask the authorised representative for evidence to prove they are allowed to claim on the Account holder’s behalf.</li>
                <li>5.4 A person can claim on behalf of a deceased Player&rsquo;s estate if they can prove, to Camelot&rsquo;s reasonable satisfaction, that they are entitled to make the claim (for example by providing a grant of probate to show their appointment as a personal representative of the deceased Player&rsquo;s estate). The person claiming will need to submit any relevant proof with the Prize Claim Form, or any other form Camelot may require. </li>
                <li>5.5 The person signing the Prize Claim Form (or any other form Camelot requires) will, if they are signing as the holder of the relevant Account, be representing that they are lawfully entitled to the Prize (or, if signing as authorised representative of the holder of the relevant Account, that they are lawfully entitled to claim the Prize on behalf of the holder) and that the information contained in the Prize Claim Form is accurate and complete. That person signing the Prize Claim Form or any other form Camelot requires (and the holder of the relevant Account, if the authorised representative is signing) will indemnify Camelot against any costs, losses, damages and expenses which Camelot may incur in relation to the Play or the Prize as a result of any misrepresentation on the Prize Claim Form (or such other form Camelot requires).</li>
                <li>5.6 Once payment of the Prize has been made to the person shown on the Prize Claim Form or any other form Camelot requires (or that person&rsquo;s authorised representative), Camelot and its officers, employees, representatives, contractors and any person, firm or company authorised by Camelot to pay Prizes will have no further liability for payment of that Prize.</li>
                <li>5.7 Camelot is entitled to refuse to process any payment if a Prize Claim Form (or any other form required by Camelot) is incomplete.</li>

<ul class="list">
                <li>6.1 Before a Prize will be paid on a Play, it must be successfully validated. If a Play is not validated, Camelot will not be liable to pay a Prize in respect of that Play.</li>
                <li>6.2 Without limiting the effect of Rule 6.1, a Play will be declared invalid and Camelot will not, therefore, be liable to pay any Prize if:
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) for any reason, whether or not involving negligence by Camelot, and including any error or omission in the coding, development, presentation or implementation of the Game, a Pay to Play Game operates differently from its description in the Game Procedures or operates so that Your chances of winning Prizes or the expected Prize payout are materially greater than as set out in the Game Procedures. In that case, You will be entitled to a refund of the price of the Play but You will not be entitled to a Prize; or </li>
<li>(aa) the Play is the result of an act by You or another person that was intended to increase the chances of You or that person winning a Prize in the relevant Pay to Play Game above the chances enjoyed by other Players of that Pay to Play Game, or to increase that Prize; or </li>
                    <li>(b) the Play is counterfeit, all or part of the Play has been forged, or the Play fails to pass Camelot&rsquo;s validation and security checks; or </li>
                    <li>(c) the Prize claim is not received within the relevant Claim Period; or </li>
                    <li>(d) the Play Number for the Play is not on Camelot&rsquo;s official list of Winning Plays, or the relevant Prize for the Winning Play with that Play Number has been paid previously; or </li>
                    <li>(e) the details associated with the Play Number of a Play do not match Camelot&rsquo;s official records of that Play Number; or </li>
                    <li>(f) Camelot reasonably believes that the Play was bought by or on behalf of a person falling in one of the categories in Rule 1.6. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>6.3 Without limiting the effect of Rule 6.1, a Play may be declared invalid and a Prize may not be payable if:
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>(a) Camelot reasonably believes that the person claiming the Prize is not the holder of the relevant Account or that person&rsquo;s duly authorised representative, or that the information provided by the person claiming the Prize is incomplete or has been altered or tampered with; or </li>
                    <li>(b) the Play Number, Play Symbols and Captions (or any other unique feature of the Play) don’t match exactly those on Camelot’s Computer System for the Instant Win Game that the Play relates to; or </li>
                    <li>(c) the Play is defective, in whole or in part; or</li>
                    <li>(d) the outcome of a Play as displayed on the Game Play Window is inconsistent with the result of that Play as predetermined by Camelot’s Computer System; or</li>
